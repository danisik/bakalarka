    <instruction_text>The better assessment, the higher mark, i.e. 0 = the poorest mark, 10 = the best mark (the only exception is the 'Amount of rewriting' field where 0 means 'no rewriting necessary' and 10 means 'the paper must be entirely rewritten'). Please, use your common sense or ask the organizers if unsure.</instruction_text>
